# Final Project for HMM gpV #

###To Do List: ###

- [ ] Check out U-Net ++
- [ ] How to include Slurm (having trouble in hw03)
- [ ] Find which data preprocessing functions from hw can be used for model(s)
- [ ] Determine which satellites or whether we use the entire satellite dataset
- [ ] Determine what findings we want
- [ ] How to present findings (StreamLit? for frontend)

## NOTHING ABOVE IS CONCRETE ##

## What we've done ##
- Hw 01, 02

## What we want to do ##
- Overall, we want a plan to execute on for the final project so we have some direction (how much is hw03 worth for what we want?)
- Then, figure out the pull request
- Then, get help on hw03 (might move up in priority)
